I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Instituto de Matem치ticas, UNAM, under the supervision of [Dr. Pablo Pelaez-Menaldo](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Pelaez%2C+P). My doctoral committee is composed of [Dr. Luis Jorge S치nchez-Salda침a](https://sites.google.com/im.unam.mx/luisjorgesanchezsaldana/) and [Dr. Javier Elizondo-Huerta](https://www.matem.unam.mx/fsd/javier). I am currently working in the Bloch-Beillinson-Murre conjecture but I am also greatly interested in Calabi-Yau varieties and mirrror symmetry. I hold a master degree in Mathematics also by UNAM, my master thesis was supervised by [Dr. Juan Garza-Ledesma](https://research.tec.mx/vivo-tec/display/PID_478781) and provided some insights about an open problem regarding the classification of surfaces of general type.
