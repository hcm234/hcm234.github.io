I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the Instituto de Matem치ticas, UNAM, under the supervision of [Dr. Pablo Pelaez-Menaldo](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Pelaez%2C+P). My doctoral committee is composed of [Dr. Luis Jorge S치nchez-Salda침a](https://sites.google.com/im.unam.mx/luisjorgesanchezsaldana/) and [Dr. Javier Elizondo-Huerta](https://www.matem.unam.mx/fsd/javier). I am currently working on the Bloch-Beilinson-Murre conjecture, and I am also greatly interested in Calabi-Yau varieties and mirror symmetry. I hold a master's degree in Mathematics from UNAM. My master's thesis, supervised by [Dr. Juan Garza-Ledesma](https://research.tec.mx/vivo-tec/display/PID_478781) provided some insights into an open problem regarding the classification of surfaces of general type.

I am also currently pursuing a master's degree in Economics from the University of Montevideo.

As the reader has probably already inferred, my main interest is algebraic geometry. However, I am also interested in algebraic topology, statistics-econometrics, and economic theory. I am always open to helping undergraduate students. If you are an undergraduate student and interested in doing your thesis with me, feel free to send me an email
