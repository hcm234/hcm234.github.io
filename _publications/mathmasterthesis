excerpt: 'My master thesis was about an open problem in the classification of surfaces of general type. My master thesis was about an open problem in the classification of surfaces of general type. In particular, studied the classification of surfaces of general type with $$ K^2\leq6 and p_g=4 $$. Using Miles Reid's graded ring methods, it provided some insights about the connectedness of the moduli space of such surfaces.'
