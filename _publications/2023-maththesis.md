I studied the classification of surfaces of general type with $$K^2 = 6$$ and $$p_g=4$$ together with my advisor, using Miles Reid's graded rings method. We conjectured that Miles Reid's methods could provide insights into Calabi-Yau 3-folds. Sadly, I am no longer working on this problem, but I hope this text inspires new students to delve into surfaces of general type and Calabi-Yau 3-folds.
