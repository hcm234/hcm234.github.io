excerpt: 'My master thesis was about an open problem in the classification of surfaces of general type. In particular, I studied the classification of surfaces of general type with $$K^2 \leq 6$$ and $$p_g=4$$. Using Miles Reid graded ring methods, it provided some insights about the connectedness of the moduli space of such surfaces.'
