This study leverages the roll-out strategy of Fiber to the Home (FTTH) in Uruguay to estimate the impact of enhanced internet quality on learning outcomes. We employ a staggered difference-in-differences model at the block geographical level to analyze this impact. Additionally, we propose an analysis of heterogeneous effects and explore the possible mechanisms behind the observed results.
